Each file in the cs455.hadoop.airline.jobs package can be run as a main for limited runs and all

  follow the convention: cs455.hadoop.airline.<Class> input output
  
An additional main is present in AllJobs which will run each job back to back following the standard

  convention: cs455.hadoop.airline.AllJobs input output
  
  **The program will append /<job> to the output path specified for easy analysis.
  
  **It's important to format your output path like ""/path/to/files" to prevent "/path/to/files//<job>"

Q7: My analysis program looks at security delays by month over the year 2003-2008 (Security delay started
      being logged after June 2003) with an attempt to link times of the year to violent security threats.
      The bulk of the analysis happens in AirportSecurityAnalysis.ods with data provided by the Security.java
      Hadoop job.


/analysis/ contains the answers to Q1-Q6 as well as the deeper analysis into Q7
